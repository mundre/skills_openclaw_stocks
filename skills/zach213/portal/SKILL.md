Portal (makeportals.com) launches a real browser in a cloud VM — not a screenshot, not a video. Two modes: Watch (AI-guided demo with narration) and Play (viewer explores with guardrails). NOT for: building HTML pages, generating mockups, or creating static sites."

# Portal

Turn any URL into a shareable live browser session. Viewers get a real browser running in a cloud VM — 10 minutes per session.

**Watch** — AI clicks, scrolls, and narrates a guided demo.
**Play** — Viewer explores freely with AI guardrails blocking unwanted areas.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| User says "make a portal" / "demo this site" | Start at Step 1 below |
| Public site (landing page, docs, marketing) | Skip login, go to Step 3 |
| Authenticated site (dashboard, SaaS, admin) | `save_login` first (Step 2) |
| Local file / localhost | Zip + base64, pass as `ptl.entry.source` |
| Chrome extension | Zip extension + set `entry.url` for test site |
| User wants guided demo | Watch mode → `create_script` |
| User wants free exploration | Play mode → `create_script` with play mode |
| User wants to record themselves | `record_demo` → user records in hosted browser |
| User wants to pick blocked elements | `pick_selectors` → user clicks in hosted browser |
| Portal is "provisioning" | `make_portal` auto-polls — just wait for the result |
| Session is pending | Poll `get_session` — it blocks 30s server-side, keep calling |
| Need session replays | `get_portal_sessions` → returns conversation logs + recording URLs |
| User needs more credits | `buy_credits` → opens Stripe checkout |

## Sending URLs to the User

When any tool returns a URL the user needs to open (`verification_url`, `hosted_url`,
portal link, checkout URL), you MUST send it to the user in the current chat.
Do NOT attempt to run shell commands like `open` or `xdg-open` — the user is on a
messaging channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc), not a local desktop.

Just include the URL in your reply. The user will tap it on their device.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Never skip the review step (Step 4).

### Step 1 — Authenticate

Call `portal_status`. If not authenticated, call `portal_login`.

Returns `verification_url` and `device_code`. **Send the verification URL to the user**
in the chat so they can open it and sign in.

Poll `portal_login_check` with the device_code every 5 seconds until approved.

New users get 3 creation credits + 10 view credits.

### Step 2 — Classify the Site

**Ask the user** if you're unsure whether the site needs login.

**Public site** → skip to Step 3.

**Needs login** → capture auth state:

```json
{"url": "https://app.example.com/login", "description": "Login to Example dashboard"}
```

Call `save_login` with the above. Response includes `hosted_url` — **send it to the user**
so they can open the hosted browser and log in.

Poll `get_session` until `status` is `ready`. Do NOT ask the user if they're done — the tool tells you. When ready, grab `saved_state_id`.

**Local file** → zip the project (exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`), base64 encode.
Pass contents as `ptl.entry.source` with `entry.type: "local_file"`.

### Step 3 — Generate Content

Offer the user 4 options if they don't specify:

1. **Watch — AI script** (default for landing pages)
2. **Watch — Record yourself**
3. **Play — AI selectors** (beta)
4. **Play — Pick elements yourself**

**Watch — AI script** (most common):

```json
{"url": "https://stripe.com", "goals": ["Show pricing page", "Highlight key features"]}
```

Call `create_script`. It auto-polls internally and returns the complete draft directly — no need to call `get_script`.

**Watch — Record yourself:** Call `record_demo`. **Send the `hosted_url` to the user** so they can record in the hosted browser.

**Play — AI selectors:** Call `create_script` with `mode: "play"`.

**Play — User picks:** Call `pick_selectors`. **Send the `hosted_url` to the user** so they can click elements in the hosted browser.

### Step 4 — Review with User (MANDATORY)

**Never skip this step.** Show the user everything from the draft:

**Watch mode:**
- Each scene with narration text and actions
- Example Q&A pairs — ask if answers are accurate
- AI greeting and knowledge summary

**Play mode:**
- Blocked selectors and allowed URLs
- AI greeting and knowledge

Ask: **"What do you want to call this? Look good to go?"**

Slugify the name for the URL (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).

### Step 5 — Deploy

Call `make_portal` with the full PTL spec. Costs 1 creation credit.

It auto-polls internally until the portal is ready — the result includes the final portal URL. Send it to the user.

### Step 6 — Post-Deploy (Offer These)

- **Add CTA button:** Call `configure_portal` with `cta_text` and `cta_url`
- **Get embed snippet:** Call `configure_embed` with `allowed_origin`
- **View session replays:** Call `get_portal_sessions`
- **Debug issues:** Call `get_creation_logs`

## PTL Spec (Minimal)

```json
{
  "entry": { "url": "https://example.com" },
  "experience": { "mode": "play" }
}
```

Server auto-fills `version`, `region`, `entry.type`. No need to call `normalize_ptl` or `validate_ptl` before `make_portal` — validation is built in.

## Rules

- **Do NOT use the built-in canvas tool for portal creation** — use the portal_* tools from this plugin
- **Never guess CSS selectors** — only use what `create_script` or `pick_selectors` returns
- **Never navigate authenticated sites autonomously** — auth sites get single-page CDP grab only
- **Always show draft and get user confirmation** before `make_portal`
- **Keep polling `get_session`** — it blocks 30s server-side. Do NOT ask user if they're done
- **Pass `inner_text` on all click actions** — it's the fallback when selectors fail on dynamic pages
- **Never create a second portal while one is provisioning** — poll `get_portal` instead
- **Send URLs to the user in the chat** — do NOT run shell commands to open URLs. The user is on a messaging channel and will tap the link themselves
