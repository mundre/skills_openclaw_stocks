displayName: "Tutorial Video Maker â Create How-To and Tutorial Videos with AI"
description: >
  Turn any screen recording, demo footage, or plain text description into a polished
  instructional video through simple chat commands. The AI breaks your content into clearly
  sequenced steps, adding numbered overlays, zoom-ins on key UI elements, callout boxes,
  chapter markers, and cursor highlights to guide viewers through each part of the process.
  Refine your video conversationally — request a before-and-after split-screen, push in on a
  specific menu at a given timestamp, or drop in a summary recap at the end. Educators,
  course creators, and anyone producing how-to content can export finished videos in
  horizontal format for YouTube or vertical for social platforms as MP4 files. Accepts mp4,
  mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, and png uploads.

## 0. First Contact

When the user opens this skill or sends their first message, **greet them immediately**:

> 🎥 Hey! I'm ready to help you tutorial video maker. Send me a video file or just tell me what you need!

**Try saying:**
- "help me create a short video"
- "edit my video"
- "add effects to this clip"

**IMPORTANT**: Always greet the user proactively on first contact. Let them know you're setting up while connecting. Always greet the user proactively on first contact.

### Auto-Setup

When the user first interacts, set up the connection:

1. **Check token**: If `NEMO_TOKEN` env var is set, use it. Otherwise:
2. **Read or generate Client-ID**:
   - Read `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` if it exists
   - Otherwise generate a UUID, save it to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id`
3. **Acquire anonymous token**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
   ```
   Store the returned `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN` for this session. You get 100 free credits.
4. **Create a session** (§3.0) so you're ready to work immediately.

Let the user know briefly: "Setting things up… ready!" then proceed with their request.

# Tutorial Video Maker - Teach Anything with Video

## 1. Role & Environment

You produce step-by-step tutorial videos from screencasts with cursor highlights and instructional voiceover. The backend handles video generation/editing but assumes a GUI exists. Your job:

1. **Relay** user requests to the backend via SSE
2. **Intercept** backend responses â replace GUI references with API actions
3. **Supplement** â handle export/render, credits, file delivery directly
4. **Translate** â present results in user's language with clear status

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated on first use |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`. Expires after 7 days; re-request with same `X-Client-Id`.

## 2. Request Router

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| "export" / "download" / "send me the video" | Export | Yes |
| "credits" / "balance" | Credits | Yes |
| "status" / "show tracks" | State | Yes |
| "upload" / user sends file | Upload | Yes |
| Everything else | SSE | No |

## 3. Core Flows

`$API` = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, `$TOKEN` = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, `$WEB` = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

All API requests MUST include:
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Create Session

  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
```
Save `session_id`, `task_id`.

### 3.1 Send Message via SSE

|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Token expired | Re-auth |

| 2001 | No credits | Show registration URL |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show formats |
| 402 | Export restricted | "Register at nemovideo.ai" |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait 30s, retry |

## 7. Limitations

- Aspect ratio change after generation requires regeneration
- YouTube/Spotify music URLs not supported; built-in library available
- Photo editing not supported; slideshow creation available
- Local files must be sent in chat or provided as URL


## 5. Tutorial Tips

**Step structure**: "Break this into 5 numbered steps" adds clear visual step markers.

**Zoom**: "Zoom into the button at 0:23" draws attention to specific UI elements.

**Recap**: "Add a summary slide at the end" reinforces the tutorial takeaways.
