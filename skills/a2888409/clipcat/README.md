# Clipcat OpenClaw Skill

This skill enables Claude Code to interact with Clipcat.ai's API for TikTok e-commerce video creation.

## Features

- **Video Replication**: One-click replication from TikTok/Douyin links
- **Product Video Generation**: Create videos from product images

## Setup

1. Get your API key from [Clipcat.ai](https://clipcat.ai/workspace?modal=settings&tab=apikeys)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export CLIPCAT_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

- "Replicate this TikTok video with my product images"
