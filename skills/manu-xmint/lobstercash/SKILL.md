  Use this skill when the user wants to spend money, make purchases, send crypto, pay for APIs, browse websites for shopping, complete checkout, or manage an AI agent's payment wallet. Covers buying products online with credit cards (including browser-automated checkout), sending tokens, paying for x402 protocol APIs, checking balances, depositing funds, browsing available services, and signing on-chain transactions — all with secure guardrails, and appropriate human controls. Trigger on any spending, wallet, or shopping intent: "buy this", "pay for that", "send tokens", "how much do I have", "what can I buy", "top up my wallet", "get a card", "set up payments", "find me something to buy", "complete the checkout", or "browse that site" — even if the user doesn't mention "lobster", "crypto", or "Solana" directly.

# Lobster Cash CLI Skill

The Lobster Cash CLI (`lobstercash`) gives AI agents payment tools — a blockchain wallet, virtual cards for buying anything online, cloud browser automation for browsing sites and completing checkout, and x402 protocol support for paying APIs — all with human approval in the loop. Use `lobstercash <command> --help` for full flag details on any command.

## Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @crossmint/lobster-cli
```

After installation, all commands are available via the `lobstercash` binary.

## Steps to use this skill

### 1. Version check (automatic)

The CLI automatically checks for updates on every API call. If an update notice appears in the command output, tell the user and offer to run `npm update -g @crossmint/lobster-cli`. If the notice says the update is **required**, you must also update the skill from https://www.lobster.cash/install before continuing. Do not run separate version-check commands.

### 2. Select lobstercash agent to use

Every lobstercash command operates on the **active agent**. Before doing anything else, make sure the right agent is selected.

```bash
lobstercash agents list
```

Then follow this decision tree:

1. **You see yourself in the list and it says `(active)`** → You're good. Move on.
2. **You see yourself in the list but it's NOT active** → Run `lobstercash agents set-active <agentId>` with the matching ID, then move on.
3. **No agent matches you** (or the list is empty) → Register a new one. Read the [agents reference](references/agents.md) for how to register one.

**How to recognize yourself:** Match by name. If you are Claude Code, look for an agent named "Claude Code" or similar. Same for Cursor, Codex, Gemini, etc. If you aren't sure, ask the user which agent to use.

### 3. Route based on the user's intent

Determine which scenario applies and follow the corresponding section:

- **A) Buy something online** (product, subscription, domain, service) → [Buy with a card](#a-buy-something-with-a-card)
- **B) Pay for a paid API endpoint** (x402 protocol) → [Pay an API with x402](#b-pay-an-api-with-x402)
- **C) Anything else** (check balance, send crypto, view status, link wallet, browse examples) → [Other actions](#c-other-actions)

---

#### A) Buy something with a card

Use when the user wants to purchase a product, subscription, domain, or any item from an online store checkout.

Virtual cards are backed by the user's credit card — no USDC or wallet funding needed. This is the fastest payment path.

##### Step 1: Request a virtual card

```bash
lobstercash cards request --amount <amount> --description "<what it's for>"
```

Extract the amount and description from context — don't ask if the user already told you (e.g. "buy me a $25 AWS credit" → `--amount 25 --description "AWS credits"`).

This command handles everything — if the wallet isn't configured yet, it bundles setup automatically.

##### Step 2: Get user approval

The command outputs an `approvalUrl`. Show it to the user:

> To create this card I need your approval. Open this link:
>
> [approvalUrl]
>
> Come back here when you've approved it.

**Do not proceed until the user confirms they approved.** Do not poll.

##### Step 3: Verify and get card credentials

After approval, list cards and get the credentials for checkout:

```bash
lobstercash cards list
lobstercash cards reveal --card-id <id> --merchant-name "<store>" --merchant-url "<https://...>" --merchant-country <XX>
```

The `card-id` comes from the `cards list` output. Merchant details must be real — extract from the purchase context, don't invent them.

**Product discovery with browser:** When the user wants to buy something (e.g. "buy me running socks"), **do NOT guess product URLs or category paths** from your training data. Instead, discover real URLs first:

1. **Web search** to find the right page: search for "running socks site:nike.com" or "best running socks to buy online" to get real, current URLs
2. **Open the best result**: `lobstercash browser open "https://nike.com/w/running-socks-7ny3qzy7ok"` (use the URL from the search result, not a guess)
3. **Extract products** from the page: `lobstercash browser extract "product names, prices, and links"`
4. Present the real results to the user and let them pick

If the user hasn't specified a merchant, web search to find good options first. If no good search results, fall back to opening the merchant's homepage and navigating from there:

```bash
lobstercash browser open "https://nike.com"
lobstercash browser act "search for running socks"
```

**Never invent URLs or paths from your training data.** Always get URLs from web search results or by navigating the site's own UI. URL structures differ across every site and change frequently.

Once the user picks something (or if they came in already knowing what they want), route to one of the branches below.

##### Step 4: Complete the purchase

Use the revealed card number, CVC, and expiry to fill in the checkout form. Treat these values as sensitive — don't log them unnecessarily.

See [cards request reference](references/cards-request.md) for full output format, and [cards reference](references/cards.md) for listing, revealing, and card phases.

---

## B) Pay an API with x402

Use when the user wants to call a paid API endpoint that uses the x402 payment protocol. The CLI handles the payment negotiation automatically: the server returns HTTP 402, the CLI pays with USDC from the agent wallet, and the server returns the content.

### Step 1: Ensure the wallet has funds

```bash
lobstercash status
```

Route based on the result:

- **Wallet configured + has enough funds** → proceed to step 2.
- **Wallet configured + insufficient funds** → run `lobstercash crypto deposit --amount <needed> --description "<description>"` to top up, show the approval URL, wait for user confirmation, then proceed.
- **Wallet not configured** → run `lobstercash crypto deposit --amount <needed> --description "<description>"` (bundles wallet creation + deposit). Show the approval URL, wait for user confirmation, verify with `lobstercash status`, then proceed.

The `--description` must explain what the agent will spend the funds on — derive it from the user's task, not generic filler like "top up wallet".

See [deposit reference](references/deposit.md) for the full deposit flow.

### Step 2: Fetch the paid endpoint

```bash
lobstercash crypto x402 fetch <url>
```

For POST requests add `--json '{"key": "value"}'`. For custom headers add `--header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`.

Show the approval URL to the user, wait for them to confirm they approved, then list cards to get the card ID. See [request card reference](references/request-card.md) for details and [cards reference](references/cards.md) for listing/revealing credentials.

#### Completing checkout with the browser

After the card is created, use browser commands to complete the purchase. This is the recommended approach — the user can watch the browser session live via the provided URL.

1. **Open the merchant site** (if not already in a browser session):

   ```bash
   lobstercash browser open "https://merchant.com/checkout"
   ```

   Share the `Live view` URL with the user so they can watch along.

2. **Navigate to checkout** using natural-language actions:

   ```bash
   lobstercash browser act "add the item to cart"
   lobstercash browser act "go to checkout"
   ```

3. **Fill the payment form** — card credentials are handled server-side and never reach the agent:

   ```bash
   lobstercash browser fill-card \
     --card-id <id> \
     --merchant-name "<name>" \
     --merchant-url "https://..." \
     --merchant-country US
   ```

4. **Fill shipping/billing** details and review order:

   ```bash
   lobstercash browser act "fill in shipping address: ..."
   lobstercash browser screenshot
   ```

   Show the screenshot or ask the user to check the live view before placing the order.

5. **Place the order** only after user confirms:

   ```bash
   lobstercash browser act "click place order"
   ```

6. **Close the session** when done:
   ```bash
   lobstercash browser close
   ```

**Important:** Always share the live view URL with the user so they can watch the checkout. Before clicking "place order" or equivalent, ask the user to confirm — do not submit orders autonomously. Card credentials never leave the server; the `fill-card` command handles them securely.

See [browser reference](references/browser.md) for all browser commands.

### Step 3: Report the result

Report what the API returned (the `body` field), not the payment mechanics. Only mention the payment if the user asks.

If the fetch fails, add `--debug` and run again. See [x402 reference](references/x402.md) for output format and common failures.

## C) Other actions

For everything else — checking balances, sending crypto, viewing wallet status, linking a wallet, or browsing examples — use the matching command from the Quick Reference below and read the corresponding reference file for details.

**Run the command, report its output.** For read-only commands (`crypto balance`, `status`, `examples`), execute them directly and report what they say. Do not pre-check status and construct your own summary — the CLI output already handles unconfigured states with clear messaging. If a command fails with exit code 2 (wallet not set up), tell the user and offer to run `lobstercash setup` or the appropriate setup-bundling command.

Common actions:

- **Check balance:** `lobstercash crypto balance` → [balance reference](references/balance.md)
- **Send tokens:** `lobstercash crypto send --to <addr> --amount <n> --token usdc` → [send reference](references/send.md)
- **View wallet status:** `lobstercash status` → [status reference](references/status.md)
- **Browse examples:** `lobstercash examples` → [examples reference](references/examples.md)
- **Link wallet / configure agent (setup only):** `lobstercash setup` → [setup reference](references/setup.md). Use when the user says "configure", "set up", "link wallet", or similar — and isn't trying to make a purchase.
- **Sign/submit a transaction:** `lobstercash crypto tx create` → [tx reference](references/tx.md)

For crypto operations (`crypto send`, `crypto tx create`), always run `lobstercash status` first to confirm the wallet is configured and has sufficient funds. If not, use `lobstercash crypto deposit --amount <needed> --description "<description>"` to fund it — see [deposit reference](references/deposit.md).

## Quick Reference

```bash
lobstercash agents register --name "<name>" --description "<desc>" --image-url "<url>"  # register a new agent

```

## Output Contract

- All commands produce human-readable output to stdout.
- Errors go to stderr as plain text.
- Exit 0 = success. Exit 1 = unexpected error. Exit 2 = wallet not set up (use `cards request` or `crypto deposit` to set up).

## Decision Tree

- Read [examples](references/examples.md) if the user wants to browse working examples, or has no specific task yet
- Read [status](references/status.md) if the user asks about agent status or payment readiness
- Read [balance](references/balance.md) if the user wants to check token balances
- Read [cards request](references/cards-request.md) if the user wants to request a virtual card for a purchase (Credit Card Path)
- Read [deposit](references/deposit.md) if the user wants to deposit USDC, top up their wallet, or fund a crypto operation
- Read [cards](references/cards.md) if the user needs to list or reveal credentials for an existing virtual card
- Read [browser](references/browser.md) if the user wants to browse a website, complete a checkout, find products, or interact with a web page
- Read [send](references/send.md) if the user wants to send tokens to an address (Crypto Path)
- Read [x402](references/x402.md) if the user wants to pay for an API via x402 protocol (Crypto Path)
- Read [tx](references/tx.md) if the user needs to sign or submit a transaction from an external tool (Crypto Path)
- Read [setup](references/setup.md) if the user wants to link the agent to a wallet without making a purchase
- Read [agents](references/agents.md) if the user wants to register, list, or set the active agent

## Anti-Patterns

- **Running crypto commands without checking status first:** Always run `lobstercash status` before `crypto send`, `crypto x402 fetch`, or `crypto tx create`. If the wallet isn't configured or has insufficient funds, the command will fail with a confusing error. Check first, fund if needed, then execute.
- **Running setup when the user wants to buy something:** If the user wants to make a purchase, don't run `setup` first — use `cards request` or `crypto deposit` which bundle setup automatically. Only use `lobstercash setup` when the user explicitly wants to link the agent to their wallet without buying anything.
- **Re-running setup when the agent is already configured:** If `lobstercash status` shows the wallet is already configured, do not generate a new setup session. The existing configuration is valid. Only start a fresh setup if the user explicitly tells you their current configuration is broken and needs to be regenerated.
- **Asking the user for info the CLI can fetch:** Check balance before sending. Check status before acting. Read command output before asking questions.
- **Running write commands in loops:** One attempt, read the result, then decide. Read operations (`crypto balance`, `status`, `examples`) are idempotent and safe to repeat. Write operations (`crypto send`, `cards request`) are not.
- **Ignoring terminal status:** A pending transaction is not a success. All write commands now wait for on-chain confirmation by default.
- **Polling for HITL approval:** When a command returns an approval URL, the user must tell you they approved. Do not auto-poll.
- **Running commands before registering an agent:** Always ensure an agent exists via `lobstercash agents list` before running any other command. If you need to work with a different agent, use `lobstercash agents set-active`.
- **Recommending cards for crypto-only integrations:** If the integration only uses crypto, don't suggest a virtual card.
- **Requiring USDC for card-supported integrations:** Virtual cards are backed by credit cards, not USDC. Don't tell the user to "add funds" when the integration accepts cards.
- **Treating x402/send/tx as separate user flows:** They all go through the same Crypto Path. The only split is credit card vs crypto.
- **Suggesting `crypto deposit` or `cards request` when the user just wants to connect:** If the user wants to check balance, run a crypto command, or simply link their wallet — without topping up or creating a card — guide them through `lobstercash setup` first. Don't jump to `crypto deposit` or `cards request` unless the user actually wants to fund the wallet or make a purchase.
- **Jumping to readiness checks before showing options:** Show what's available first (via `examples`), then check payment readiness only when the user wants to try one.
- **Assuming an integration's payment method:** Never guess whether a flow uses cards or crypto. Run `lobstercash status` and read the payment methods output before choosing a path.
- **Hallucinating product URLs or paths:** Never guess URLs beyond the root domain. You cannot know the correct path structure for any website — `/w/socks`, `/category/socks`, `/shop/socks` are all guesses. Always `browser open` the homepage (`https://example.com`), then use `browser act` to search or navigate the site's own UI to find products.
- **Placing orders without user confirmation:** Always ask the user to confirm before clicking "place order" or similar. Show a screenshot or remind them to check the live view URL.
- **Revealing card credentials manually when using browser checkout:** Use `browser fill-card` instead of `cards reveal`. The fill-card command handles credentials server-side so they never reach the agent. Only use `cards reveal` when the user needs to manually paste credentials into a site you can't browser-automate.
- **Forgetting to share the live view URL:** When opening a browser session, always tell the user the live view URL so they can watch what's happening.
- **Running browser commands without an open session:** All browser commands except `open` require an active session. If no session exists, run `browser open` first.
- **Leaving browser sessions open:** Close sessions with `browser close` when checkout is done. Sessions consume resources on the provider.
